# Race to the End Datapack for Minecraft 1.16

Challenge your friends the long but rewarding task of defeating the ender dragon. Split up into teams of 3 and fight for the victory. Each player is given 3 lives only, once you run out, you're eliminated from the game and only allowed to spectate the remaining game as it progresses.

## Featuring

* **Teams of 3**: The game is designed to support 3 teams to battle to the end. This will be optional in a future update.
* **Sectioned game**: The game is structured into 3 segments; the starter, grace and main period.
* **Player lives**: Each player spawns with 3 lives and once they are out, they will be moved into spectator mode.
* **Minimal layout**: Any game status updates are contained in a single bossbar to ensure the screen has minimal interruptions.
